Hi. I'm Scott.

I like to write code.

At the time of writing I am a [professional developer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-anderson-09014173/) at [Scandiweb](https://scandiweb.com/), working in Latvia.
Getting my first real development job is a great feeling (but can be stressful sometimes, of course).

In my job I work with the [Magento 2 Framework](https://magento.com/products/magento-commerce) (No Magento 1 currently, but I have heard stories). I have had some hands-on with [ScandiPWA](https://scandipwa.com/) - Scandiweb's React-powered front-end for M2, and I also really like using this
I have learnt more things than I can count progressing through Scandiweb's EDU programme (no certification yet), and solving problems of all shapes and sizes.

I also like to understand Software architecture where I can **and finally** I really like to fiddle about with my `.bash_profile` to try and make the Terminal experience a bit more streamlined (or maybe just a little bit more fancy)

Below is a project that I am really proud of:

[shopping_app_test -> bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org/srmes/shopping_app_test/admin/access)

Do you want to know more about me, my developer skillset or even something else? [*email me*]("mailto:"{{ site.email }})
