Hi. I'm Scott. I'm writing with full stops because I see it in lots of documentation

I like to write code. I also like to understand Software architecture where I can **and finally** I really like to fiddle about with my `.bash_profile` to try and make the Terminal experience on my Mac a bit more streamlined (or maybe just a little bit more fancy and show-offish)

Below is a project that I am really proud of:

[shopping_app_test -> bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org/srmes/shopping_app_test/admin/access)

Do you want to know more about me, my developer skillset or even something else? *email me*: {{ site.email }}
